# Fantastic Misaventures
#### formerly Formation-Based_RPG_Project
Final Video Game Game development project for school made in Unity
The idea behind it is to make an RPG that has some sort of formation mechanic in the battle system which divides the battlefield into tiles, in a similar fashion to an SRPG (like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, SMT Devil Survivor, etc..),
The player and enemy both have a a half of the battlefield and have to position the characters along the grid and make use of the area of effect of attacks to raise efficency through strategy.
The game will be displayed from an isometric camera angle.

## Synopsis
In a medieval fantasy world where magic is normal, due to a mistak Leech, a dark elf girl, and A'en, a human prince curse each other by accident and journey across the continent in hopes of finding a magical item to dispel the curse placed upon them.
Now you take control of this party in a strategy focused RPG as you coordinate and manage them through the turn based battles all the while making them stronger to overcome the hardships of their journey.
