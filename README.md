# Fantastic Misaventures
#### formerly Formation-Based_RPG_Project
Final Video Game Game development project for school made in Unity
The idea behind it is to make an RPG that has some sort of formation mechanic in the battle system which divides the battlefield into tiles, in a similar fashion to an SRPG (like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, SMT Devil Survivor, etc..),
The player and enemy both have a a half of the battlefield and have to position the characters along the grid and make use of the area of effect of attacks to raise efficency through strategy.
The game will be displayed from an isometric camera angle.
